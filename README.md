### From the darkness, light once again emerges

A sun-tracking 24-hour analog-digital watchface inspired by the PebbleOS 3.9-era sleep tracking visualization.

### Features:

• Watch the hours of your day slip away as the sun moves through the 24-hour outer dial

* Wide variety of custom color themes to choose from!

• No internet connection required! As long as the watchface has communicated with the phone at least once, can recalculate sunrise/sunset on watch indefinitely.
